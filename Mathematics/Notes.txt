              - Factorization of Quadratic Equations and Polynomials Intro. (Online and NCERT IX)
2 09/06/2020: Binomial: Algebraic exp with two non zero terms
	      monomial: '' with only one non zero term
	      Polynomials: '' with one or more terms (non zero)
	      - Zero of a polynomeal: it's the value of variable (x) for which f(x) == 0
		(Note: it denotes the places where the graph will cut the x axis (imagine f(x) is denoting value on Y axis
		 and the value of x is X axis plot) -thanks to didi for explaining about graphs

3: 10/06/2020: Polynomial division eg (3x^2+2x+1) % (x-1) using long division method.
	       Remainder's Theorem: Let there be 2 polynomial P(x) and Q(x) where degree of P(x) > degree of Q(x),
	       Then the remainder of P(x) % Q(x) equals to the value of P(x) for x = root(zero) of Q(x).
	       This comes from the fact that while dividing something we get:
		Dividend = (Divisor Ã— Quotient) + Remainder
		P(x) = Q(x)*Quotient + Remainder
		So zero/root of Q(x) means for value of x = root, Q(x) is zero, hence if Q(x) will be zero in above 
		equation then multiplying it with Quotient will also give value = 0 and only remainder will be remaining,
		
		Hence instead of long division, we can plug in the value of zero/root in Divident to quickly get the remainder....
