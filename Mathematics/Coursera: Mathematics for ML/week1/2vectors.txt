Q1) What are vectors?
- vectors are ordered list of numbers, they can represent multiple things.
  eg it could represent coordinate [x, y], it could represent space time [x, y, z, t]
  or more generally, it can represent parameters eg y=mx+c, with vector [m, c] 

Q2) How vectors come into play while optimising?
- we represent vectors [x, y] as initial parameter, 
  then we slightly change it to [x',y'], if that results in less error (better result)
  we keep nnudging in that direction and just the opposite if error increases.
  So, basically vectors represent one set of value.
  
- We can graph it out (all possible values of result(error) for each combination of parameters)
  to get a graph/contour. 
  The point/vector with minimum error output is the most optimal value of parameter.
