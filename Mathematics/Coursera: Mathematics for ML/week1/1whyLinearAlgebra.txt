Q1) Why linear Algebra?
- It could help us some problems:
    a) Solving simultaneous equations:
       Price discovery (find price of items if multiple iteration of purchase)
       eg. Buying 2 apples and 3 bananas for 8 euros.
           Then buying 10 apples and 1 banana for 13 euros.
           Now finding the price of each banana and apple.
    b) Fitting an equation through data (curve fitting), i.e from data trying to create an equation
       (or function) that represents data in good way, we can then get rid of data 
       for privacy/storage issue and just use that equation. (followup quetion below #2)

Q2) What is curve fitting?
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jevRLWC75k4
- For any line/curve we try to find the value of the constants 
  (eg line has 2 var "m" and "c" in straight line, y = mx + c)
- These values determine how closely the equation fits the data. 
  So basically curve fitting is a way of somehow finding value of m, c, a, b...
  what we refer to as hyper parameters (maybe? check again)
